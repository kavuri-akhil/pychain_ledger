## Secnario
I am a fintech engineer whoâ€™s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. I was recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## My Approach
In order to solve the current business problem stated by the client my approach to acheive the solution is as follows: 

1. Create a Record Data Class

2. Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

## The Results

Upon building the ledger the results are as follows, which validates the block and records the data of the transactions.
